 Abstract: A simple managed object class to record the date and process ID of a process.
 
 Run implements two additional methods:
 
 awakeFromInsert:
 This sets the date of a Run instance to the date at which it is first inserted into a managed object context.
 
 setNilValueForKey:
 This method exists to trap an attempt to set a nil value for a scalar value. The process ID is a scalar value, so if an attempt were made to set the value of processID to nil, for example:
 [aRun setValue:nil forKey:@"processID"];
 this method would be invoked. In this case, the value is simply set to 0.
 
 In addition, Run uses a class extension to declare primitive accessors for the date property, used by the awakeFromInsert: method.
